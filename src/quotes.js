        quote: "If your heart hurts a little after letting go of someone or something, that's okay. It just means that your feelings were genuine. No one likes ends. And no one likes pain. But sometimes we have to put things that were once good to an end after they turn toxic to our well-being. Not every new beginning is meant to last forever.

        quote: "Don't personalize or internalize other people's behavior. What they do is not a reflection of you. Their actions represent them and where they are in their growth. Just observe instead of getting caught up and overreacting emotionally.",
        author: "Idil Ahmed",
    },
    {
        quote: "Take a little time to be amazed by something you won't enjoy unless you consciously choose to focus on it. See the things you can't see when you're rushing. Hear the things you can't hear when you're stressing. Get so caught up in your senses that everything else seems to stop for a moment—because things don't actually stop. So we have to be the ones who do it.",
        author: "Lori Deschene",
    },
    {

        quote: "You're so hard on yourself. But remember, everybody has a chapter they don't read out loud. Take a moment. Sit back. Marvel at your life; at the mistakes that gave you wisdom, at the suffering that gave you strength. Despite everything, you still move forward, be proud of this. Continue to endure. Continue to persevere. And remember, no matter how dark it gets, the sun will rise again.",

        author: "Unknown",
    },
    {
        quote: "I think something people need to understand is that others disliking you is not a bad thing. When you are embodying your true authentic self, it creates fear in people who still operate from the ego. If you want to grow, heal, and evolve you have to let go of wanting to be liked.",

        author: "Unknown",
    },
    {
        quote: "None of us are getting out of here alive, so stop treating yourself like an afterthought. Eat the delicious food. Walk in the sunshine. Jump in the ocean. Say the truth you're carrying in your heart like hidden treasure. Be silly. Be kind. Be weird. There's no time for anything else.",

        quote: "You just never know what someone is dealing with behind closed doors. No matter how happy someone looks, how loud their laugh is, how big their smile is, there can still be a level of hurt that is indescribable. So be kind. Even when others are not, choose to be kind.",
        author: "Andrea Russett",
    },
    {
        quote: "It's true: people can change. People can learn, grow, and surprise us. But if someone does the same thing, over and over again—if they keep hurting, disrespecting, or disappointing you—it's time to accept the way things are and ask yourself if you can really live with this. You can't make someone change their pattern if they're not willing or ready, but you can stop participating in it.",

        quote: "Sometimes things have to go wrong before they can go right. Sometimes we have to let the wrong people walk out before we allow the right people to walk in. Sometimes we have to feel weak in order to know what it's like to feel strong. Sometimes you have to be broken to realize you'll never be shattered.",
        author: "Unknown",
    },
    {
        quote: "Maybe the problem isn't that you are too sensitive. Maybe the problem is that they lack the emotional intelligence required to process empathy. The problem is that they aren't sensitive enough.",

        quote: "Some people are empowered by travel and some are inspired by the warmth of home. Some thrive in the spotlight and some feel called to support those who are on stage. Some people are comfortable half-dressed and cussing like sailors and others prefer modesty and gentleness. The thing is: we are all empowered and inspired in different ways, and it's not our job to decide what that looks like for anyone else.",
        author: "Brooke Hampton",

        quote: "It's easy to judge. It's more difficult to understand. Understanding requires compassion, patience, and a willingness to believe that good hearts sometimes choose poor methods. Through judging, we separate. Through understanding, we grow.",
